Parallel Programming Assignment in C#

Objective:
Learn how to implement parallel tasks in C# and measure their performance.

Instructions:

Generate Random Data:

Create a list containing 10,000 random integers.
Clone Data:

Clone the original list into 5 separate lists.
Parallel Sorting Tasks:

Create 5 parallel tasks to sort each list using different sorting algorithms. You can choose from:
QuickSort
MergeSort
HeapSort
BubbleSort (for comparison, even though it's slower)
Built-in C# List.Sort() method
Measure Execution Time:

Measure the execution time of each sorting task.
Identify which algorithm sorts the list the fastest in each iteration.
Repeat the Process:

Repeat steps 1–4 1,000 times.
Statistical Analysis:

Count how many times each sorting algorithm was the fastest.
Determine which algorithm consistently performs the best.
Deliverables:

Submit your code with proper documentation.
Provide a summary of your results, including:
Execution times for each algorithm.
A final table/statistics showing which algorithm had the highest number of fastest executions.
